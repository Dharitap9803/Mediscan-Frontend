- **Step Tracker Page**: Shows user's step data for daily, weekly, and monthly periods with a summary graph, maximum/minimum step count, and insightful tracking metrics.
- **Heartbeat Rate Page**: Monitors pulse readings with daily/weekly/monthly graphs and a breakdown of average, highest, and lowest heartbeat rates.
- **Sleep Hours Page**: Tracks sleep duration trends with detailed analysis of sleep quality across days, weeks, and months, and provides recovery suggestions.
- **Stress Level Page**: Displays stress patterns and critical highs using visual graphs; offers insights on stress management with data-driven suggestions.
- **Calorie Burn Page**: Shows calories burned over time, highlights workout effectiveness, and includes recommendations for improved fitness planning.
- **Blood Pressure Page**: Accepts systolic/diastolic input with contextual data like sleep and stress; provides BP classification, risk identification, and health advice per category (e.g., Stage 1, Hypertensive Crisis).
- **Diabetes Page**: Takes age, height, weight, and sugar levels to calculate BMI and categorize diabetes stage; generates lifestyle recommendations and diet/exercise tips.
- **Weight & Height Page**: Tracks BMI, weight fluctuation, and health classification (underweight, normal, overweight, obese) using bar and line graphs for trend comparison.

**Health Tracker** is a web-based application built to help users actively monitor and manage their health through comprehensive, data-driven insights.  
It includes:

- A **public-facing frontend** for users to track, upload, and view health metrics.
- A **dedicated admin panel** to review submitted reports, manage users, and oversee platform-wide health trends.

This system bridges individual health tracking with centralized monitoring to ensure users get real-time, actionable feedback while admins maintain system integrity and insights.
